<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Sitecore License Agreement </b></p>

<p><b>LICENSEE’S USE OF THE SITECORE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO LICENSEE’S FULL
ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS, CONDITIONS, DISCLAIMERS AND LICENSE RESTRICTIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT. </b></p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>1. <u>License Grant</u></span><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>: Upon payment in full of the license fee, Licensor grants Licensee
a non-exclusive, perpetual, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable
license, without time limitations, to use the Sitecore Software in supported
configurations as described in the Documentation, in compliance with all
applicable laws, in object code form only,</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
lang=EN-GB>exclusively for the Permitted Usage (as that term is defined in
Exhibit A)</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and Exhibits A and B hereto,
which are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.</span><span
lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>Except as expressly authorized by this
Agreement, “Licensee” as used herein does not include any other entity or
person, including any present or future subsidiary or affiliate of Licensee, or
any entity or person owning any interest in Licensee at present or in the
future.</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span lang=EN-GB>“Sitecore Software”
means the software that is licensed by Licensor in this Agreement, and any
future Upgrades and Patches, as those terms are defined in Section 6 of this
Agreement, that the Licensee may receive in accordance with the terms of the
Agreement. “Documentation” means the resources made available in the reference
section of the Sitecore Developer Network setting forth the then-current
functional, operational, and performance capabilities of the Sitecore Software
(http://sdn.sitecore.net/documentation).</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span></p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>1.1 License Key </b>: Licensee will be provided a License Key that gives
Licensee access to the Sitecore Software. The Sitecore Software may be used
only on the equipment with the features and limitations specified in the
License Key. The License Key shall be time-limited until full payment of the
license fee has been received by Licensor. The License Key may limit the number
of installations of the Sitecore Software and the capacity of the Servers on
which the Sitecore Software may be installed. For purposes of this Agreement,
one Server is defined as a physical or virtual Server with a processing power
for the web process equivalent to at most eight CPU cores. For example, one
physical Server may contain eight single-core CPUs, four dual-core CPUs, two
quad-core CPUs or one eight-core CPU. A Server with three or four quad-core
CPUs would therefore count as two Servers. A virtual server’s processing power
will be counted as the number of physical cores allocated or processor core
equivalents allocated to the virtual server.&nbsp; For example, one virtual
server with two physical processor cores allocated, or with the equivalent of
two simulated processor cores allocated, would be counted as the equivalent of
two CPU cores and therefore one Server. </p>

<p><b>1.2 Intellectual Property Rights </b>: The <span lang=EN-GB>Sitecore
Software includes the following patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,856,345 and
8,255,526. </span>Ownership of the Sitecore Software, and all worldwide rights,
title and interest in and to the Intellectual Property associated with the
Sitecore Software shall remain solely and exclusively with Licensor or with
third parties that license modules included with the Sitecore Software.
Licensee shall retain intact all applicable Licensor copyright, patent and/or
trademark notices on and in all copies of the Sitecore Software. All rights,
title, and interest in Sitecore Software not expressly granted to Licensee in
this Agreement are reserved by Licensor. “Intellectual Property” as used in
this Agreement means any and all patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks
and trade names (registered and unregistered), trade secrets, know-how,
inventions, licenses and all other proprietary rights throughout the world
related to the authorship, origin, design, utility, process, manufacture,
programming, functionality and operation of Sitecore Software and its
Derivative Works. </p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>1.3 Confidential Information</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>:</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><b><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; </span></b><span
lang=EN-GB>The term “Confidential Information” shall include any information,
whether tangible or intangible, including, but not limited to, techniques,
discoveries, inventions, ideas, processes, software (in source or object code
form), designs, technology, technical specifications, flow charts, procedures,
formulas, concepts, any financial data, and all business and marketing plans
and information, in each case which is maintained in confidence by the
disclosing party (“Disclosing Party”) and disclosed to the other party
(“Recipient”) hereunder. The failure by the Disclosing Party to designate any
tangible or intangible information as Confidential Information shall not give
Recipient the right to treat such information as free from the restrictions
imposed by this Agreement if the circumstances would lead a reasonable person
to believe that such information is Confidential Information. Confidential
Information does not include information which Recipient documents (a) is now,
or hereafter becomes, through no act or failure to act on the part of
Recipient, generally known or available to the public; (b) was rightfully in
Recipient’s possession prior to disclosure by the Disclosing Party; (c) becomes
rightfully known to Recipient, without restriction, from a source other than
the Disclosing Party and without any breach of duty to the Disclosing
Party;&nbsp; (d) is developed independently by Recipient without use of or reference
to any of the Confidential Information and without violation of any
confidentiality restriction contained herein; or (e) is approved by the
Disclosing Party for disclosure without restriction, in a written document
executed by a duly authorized officer of the Disclosing Party. Recipient shall
hold the Confidential Information received from the Disclosing Party in strict
confidence and shall not, directly or indirectly, disclose it, except as
expressly permitted herein. Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing
Party upon learning of any misappropriation or misuse of Confidential
Information disclosed hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipient shall
be permitted to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to a judicial or
governmental order, provided that Recipient provides the Disclosing Party
reasonable prior notice, and assistance, to contest such order.</span><span

<p><b>&nbsp; </b></p>

<p><b>1.4 Restrictions on Use </b>: Except as expressly authorized by
applicable law or by Licensor in writing, Licensee shall not copy, in whole or
in part, the Sitecore Software or Documentation, or modify, disassemble,
decompress, reverse compile, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, or translate
any portion of the Sitecore Software. Licensee shall not rent, lease, lend,
distribute, sell, assign, license, or otherwise transfer the Sitecore Software,
or create Derivative Works of the Sitecore Software. Additionally, Licensee may
use embedded third-party components in the Sitecore Software exclusively as
described in the OEM section of the Sitecore Developer Network ( <a
href="https://dev.sitecore.net/oem">http://sdn.sitecore.net/oem </a>). </p>

<p><b>1.5 &nbsp;Derivative Works </b>: “Derivative Works” as used herein means
any software program (whether in source code or object code), and all copies
thereof, developed by or on behalf of Licensee based on or derived from any
part of the Sitecore Software, including without limitation any revision,
modification, enhancement, translation (including compilation or recapitulation
by computer), abridgment, condensation, expansion, or any other form in which
the Sitecore Software may be recast, transformed or adapted, and that, if
prepared without Licensor's authorization, would constitute a patent, copyright
or trade secret infringement of the Sitecore Software, or would otherwise
constitute an unauthorized use of Licensor’s Confidential Information. In the
event any such Derivative Works are created, Licensor shall own all right,
title, and interest in and to such Derivative Works. If, under the operation of
local law or otherwise, Licensee or such third party comes to have any rights
associated with such Derivative Works, Licensee hereby and shall automatically
assign all such rights to Licensor for no additional consideration. For
avoidance of doubt, Licensor shall claim no intellectual property interest or
legal interest of any kind in any code created by Licensee to facilitate its
authorized use of the Sitecore Software so long as the creation of such code
does not constitute a Derivative Work or violate any other provision of this
Agreement. </p>

<p><b>1.6 Third Party Use and Rights </b>: Licensee may authorize third parties
to assist Licensee in the management, editing, and hosting of web-based content
created by use of the Sitecore Software, provided that: (1) such activities are
within the scope of the activities Licensee is itself authorized to perform
under this Agreement; (2) such third party’s acts are primarily for the direct
or indirect benefit of Licensee; and (3) such third parties are not charged a
fee by Licensee for such activities. Licensee is prohibited from using the
Sitecore Software as an Application Software Provider or in any time-sharing or
other commercial arrangement of any kind that makes the Sitecore Software
available to third parties primarily for the third party’s own uses. Except as
expressly stated in this Agreement, no third party has any rights under this
Agreement. Licensee is fully liable to the extent allowed by law for any
unauthorized use of the Sitecore Software by third parties caused by any acts or
omissions of Licensee. </p>

<p><b>1.7 License Verification </b>: The Sitecore Software periodically
transmits the following information to a server maintained by Licensor: License
Key ID, licensee name, hostname (Licensee’s website URL), host IP, Sitecore
Software version, and directory installation path. This information is used by
Licensor to send periodic communications to Licensee relevant to use of the
Sitecore Software, and to verify, at Licensor’s election, that the Sitecore
Software is installed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>2</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span></b><b><span

lang=EN-GB>: </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span></p>

<p><b>2.1 Licensor’s Limited Warranty </b>: Licensor expressly warrants that
the Sitecore Software provided to Licensee will work for a period of ninety
(90) days following the effective date of this Agreement according to the
Documentation. In the event any such Sitecore Software does not operate
according to the Documentation during this Limited Warranty Period, Licensor
shall repair or replace the Sitecore Software and such repair or replacement
shall be Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy.&nbsp; </p>

<p><b>2.2 </b><b><span lang=EN-GB>Virus/Malicious Code Warranty</span><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>: </span>Licensor and Licensee warrant
that they will use commercially reasonable virus and malicious code detection
software programs to test any electronic files, including electronic
communications, prior to any delivery or upon receiving such communications and
that the parties will continue to take such steps with respect to exchanging
electronic files and communications pursuant to this Agreement. In the event
either party detects any computer virus or malicious code it shall immediately
notify the other party and where possible shall promptly provide revised
replacement files in the event any such computer virus or malicious code is
detected. </p>

<p><b>&nbsp; </b></p>

<p><b>4. <u>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</u>: LICENSOR (DEFINED IN THIS SECTION AS
LICENSOR’S PARENT, AFFILIATES, SUBSIDIARIES, DISTRIBUTORS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE
OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES) SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY THIRD
PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, OR

THEORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION, THE COST OF RECOVERING ANY DATA, INFRINGEMENT, OR THE COST OF
SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF, KNOWS OF, OR SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN, OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY

<p><b><span lang=EN-GB>5. <u>Sitecore Maintenance Program</u></span><span
lang=EN-GB> </span></b><span lang=EN-GB>:</span><span lang=EN-GB> </span><span
lang=EN-GB>Licensee will automatically be enrolled in the Sitecore Maintenance
Program. For each Maintenance Program Period (as that term is defined in
Exhibit A) Licensee will be charged a non-refundable Maintenance Program Charge
(as that term is defined in Exhibit A). The Sitecore Maintenance Program
includes Upgrades and support.&nbsp;Upgrades are free of charge for as long as
Licensee is enrolled in the Maintenance Program. Three years after the date of
the initial purchase and each three-year anniversary thereafter, Licensor may
adjust the Maintenance Program Charge then in effect for all software purchased
under this Agreement to 20% of the Licensor’s then-current retail
prices.&nbsp;Licensee may cancel the Maintenance Program by providing Licensor
with 60 days notice prior to the end of any Maintenance Program
Period.&nbsp;Licensor may cancel the Maintenance Program upon Licensee’s
failure to pay timely any applicable Maintenance Program Charge. A cancelled
Maintenance Program may not be renewed except upon payment of double the amount
of fees that would have been paid during the lapsed period.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span lang=EN-GB>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><b>6. <u>Upgrades and Patches of Sitecore Software</u> </b>: “Patch” as used
in this Agreement means a specific, targeted fix to a discrete problem in the
use or functionality of the Sitecore Software that Licensor in its sole
discretion defines to constitute a “Patch” and may from time to time provide to
Licensee. “Upgrade” as used in this Agreement means a new version of some or
all of the Sitecore Software, or an improvement in the use or functionality of
the Sitecore Software more substantial than a Patch, that Licensor in its sole
discretion defines to constitute an “Upgrade” and may from time to time provide
to Licensees enrolled in the Sitecore Maintenance program. Licensee expressly
acknowledges that Upgrades and Patches may change functionality of the Sitecore
Software and integration with other systems, and may not work with some or all
of the Sitecore Software modules, or be backward compatible with earlier
versions of Sitecore Software. Installation of Patches and Upgrades is the
choice and responsibility of Licensee. To the extent that operation of the
Sitecore Software is affected by problems in standard software, including, but
not limited to, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Windows and the Microsoft.Net
Framework, then Licensee shall install updates to such standard software per
Licensor’s specifications in order to resolve these issues. Licensor has no
control over such standard software, and cannot assure that problems with such
standard software will be corrected, or that such corrections will be made in a
timely manner. </p>

<p><b>7. &nbsp;<u>Waivers</u> </b>: All waivers must be in writing and signed
by authorized representatives of the parties. Any waiver or failure to enforce
any provision of this Agreement on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of
any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. </p>

<p><b>8. &nbsp;<u>Severability</u> </b>: If any provision of this Agreement is
adjudicated to be unenforceable, such provision shall be deemed changed and
interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest
extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions shall continue
in full force and effect. </p>

<p><b>9. &nbsp;<u>Assignment</u> </b>: Licensee may not assign this Agreement,
by operation of law or otherwise, which includes any change of control in the
ownership structure of Licensee. Licensor may assign this Agreement to a
successor (whether by merger, a sale of all or a significant portion of its
assets, a sale of a controlling interest of its capital stock, or otherwise)
that agrees to assume Licensor’s obligations under this Agreement. Any
attempted assignment or transfer in violation of this Section shall be void and
of no force or effect. Subject to the provisions of this Section 9, this
Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of the parties. </p>

<p><b>10. <u>Entire Agreement</u> </b>: This Agreement, and any attachment that
is expressly incorporated in this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties regarding the subject matter hereof and supersedes all
prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings and communications, whether
written or oral. This Agreement may be amended only by a written document
signed by both parties. In the event of a conflict between any provision of
this Agreement with any other attachment or document, this Agreement shall
control. Any term or condition not specifically authorized by this Agreement
included in any Licensee invoice, purchase order or other document rendered
pursuant to this Agreement is of no force or effect unless the specific term or
condition has been previously agreed to by the parties in writing in a separate
agreement. No action by Licensor (including, without limitation, receipt of
payment of any such invoice, or acceptance of any purchase order, in whole or
in part) shall be construed as making any such term or condition binding on
Licensor. </p>
